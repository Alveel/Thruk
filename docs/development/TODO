ideas for after 1.0

general:
    - create models for hosts / services / contacts
    - webservice api, passthrough querys to livestatus and return json
      result
    - query builder, click to add filter or stats
    - _HTML field for hosts / services besides action_url/notes_url
    - show parent tree to backend, ex.: host1 -> host2 -> parent -> monitor
    - show host/service dependencies
    - add multiple notes url or action urls, maybe add an "_html" cust var
    - add ability to display contacts for machine
    - uc,lc option for auth user -> monitoring
    - multi language support
    - add context sensitive help
    - completly hide backends by contactgroups
    - addons: own template, images/themes and lib directory
    - bookmarks
    - show only backends where user has at least permission for one host/service
    - use livestatus wait feature where possible
    - page by attribute a,b,c,d,e...z


reports:
    - generate long running reports in an extra process
    - flexible report output
        HTML, Text, CVS, XML, PDF
        CSV output for single hosts/services,hostgroups/servicegroups
    - cache results from Thruk::Utils::calculate_availability, no need
      to parse logfiles twice

status:
    - proper search
        save searches (like bookmarks would do it)
    - add flexible selector, ex.: select multiple hostgroups by comma
    - host table map with worst service state as color

histogram:
    - missing completly

summary:
    - preset selections when generating new report
